Given an interaction frame between two objects, select pre-defined keypoints.

The input request contains:
    - The task information as dictionaries. The dictionary contains these fields: 
        * 'instruction': The task in natural language forms.
        * 'object_grasped': The object that the human holds in hand while executing the task.
        * 'object_unattached': The object that the human will interact with 'object_grasped' without holding it in hand. 
    - An image of the current table-top environment captured from a top-down camera, annotated with a set of visual marks:
        * candidate keypoints on 'object_grasped': Red dots marked as 'Pi' on the image, where [i] is an integer.

The interaction is specified by 'function_keypoint' on the 'object_grasped'. 

Please note:  The human hand grasps 'object_grasped' and moves the 'function_keypoint' to approach 'object_unattached'.

More specifically, the definitions of the function point is:
    - 'function_keypoint': The point on 'object_grasped' indicates the part that will contact 'object_unattached’.
  
The response should be a dictionary in JSON form, which contains:
    - 'function_keypoint': Selected from candidate keypoints marked as 'Pi' on the image. This will be '' if and only if 'object_grasped’.

Think about this step by step: First, describe the region where interaction between 'object_grasped' and 'object_unattached' happens. Second, select 'function_keypoint' on the 'object_grasped' within the interaction region.
